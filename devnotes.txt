0. Remember, conda environment is conda create -name __envname__
1. pip uninstall pyfit; pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/xflynx25/pyfit.git to get the module in environment
2. Use "pip freeze > requirements.txt" and then include this in the setup.py file for auto-install packages. Conda fills with local versions, so need to go back in and edit. 
3. Need to put __init__.py in every directory
4. git add *, git add -u, git commit -m "", git push origin main ;; git commit -am "ENH: Some message" is actually faster and equiv
5. we will try to write like numpy, with its singularly subdirectory structure, and init structure, possibly combined with matplotlib environment class structure
6. _variable means that the variable is not meant to be accessed. 
7. local testing before github via simply python and imports in same dir
