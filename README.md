# pyfit
Machine Learning Module for Python

The goals of this are manyfold:

1. To organize my efforts in ML such that I can build towards better productivity and models, and less repetition of tasks
2. To create a system where I can go from idea to model in minimum time, for arbitrary ideas
3. To eventually make this outward facing and focus on public attributes of package creation
4. To create a strong simulation/dataset_creation system where algorithms & ml properties can be explored without worrying so much on dataset curation every time
5. As an import to shrink my other codebases
