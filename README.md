# pyfit
Machine Learning Module for Python

The goals of this are manyfold:

1. To organize my efforts in ML such that I can build towards better productivity and models, and less repetition of tasks
2. To create a system where I can go from idea to model in minimum time, for arbitrary ideas
3. To eventually make this outward facing and focus on public attributes of package creation
4. To create a strong simulation/dataset_creation system where algorithms & ml properties can be explored without worrying so much on dataset curation every time
5. As an import to shrink my other codebases


That was the original thought. Currently 10/1/23, shifting to focus on "Semi-Auto ML", an interactive method for data scientists to pipeline, without feeling loss of control or total blackbox from typical autoML.
